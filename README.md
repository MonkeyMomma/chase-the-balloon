# Chase the Balloon
A simple click and chase game in JavaScript

## About
I wrote this simple game just to practice my JavaScript skills. I have been trying to learn JavaScript for over a year. I have taken a few Front End Developer courses online and have still felt I have not really been taught much JavaScript. It seems most of these programs expect even beginners to automatically know JavaScript, even when the course advertises "no prior knowledge needed". So, I have gone back to just simply trying to learn JavaScript on it's own, as a programming language.

The basic idea for this project came from <i>I'm a JavaScript Games Maker: The Basics</i>, by Max Wainewright.  This is actually a book series targeted to youth that I checked out from our local library in hopes of getting my gamer daughter interested in coding again after a series of bad teachers in her school's "coding" classes.  However, as I was going through the book, I noticed a balloon pop style game that I felt I could adapt to a bit more advanced code layout and practice my JavaScript.

I initially had trouble making the code work from the Wainewright book. I could not get it to work after switching the JavaScript into a separate file. As I was trouble shooting, I found a different example of a JavaScript canvas game on [CodeMahal](https://www.codemahal.com/javascript-and-html5-canvas-game-tutorial-code/) . I decided to use the code example on that page and make the changes I needed to make the game I was picturing in my mind.


## Notes:
The initial push to my repository contains code that is not fully working as I intend. The game is currently in a development mode.

The second push, dated 7/28/2020, is still not working as intended. This is currently being worked on.

### Use Instructions
The Favicon image used in the project is also not available. This image is the creative property of Phidget_Kitty for use by Monkey Momma Creations only. You will need to create or download your own png image and edit the code to have a favicon appear on your project.

The Star Balloon image referenced in the code is my digital creation. It will not be uploaded to git. To use this code, you will need to find an appropriate balloon image, save it to your own image folder in the file system and change the coding as needed to reflect your image's file name. Then, launch the html in your browser to play the game.
