# Chase the Balloon
A simple click and chase game in JavaScript

## About
I wrote this simple game just to practice my JavaScript skills. I have been trying to learn JavaScript for over a year. I have taken a few Front End Developer courses online and have still felt I have not really been taught much JavaScript. It seems most of these programs expect even beginners to automatically know JavaScript, even when the course advertises "no prior knowledge needed". So, I have gone back to just simply trying to learn JavaScript on it's own, as a programming language.

The basic idea for this project came from <i>I'm a JavaScript Games Maker: The Basics</i>, by Max Wainewright.  This is actually a book series targeted to youth that I checked out from our local library in hopes of getting my gamer daughter interested in coding again after a series of bad teachers in her school's "coding" classes.  However, as I was going through the book, I noticed a balloon pop style game that I felt I could adapt to a bit more advanced code layout and practice my JavaScript.

### Use Instructions
The Star Balloon image referenced in the code is my digital creation. It will not be uploaded to git. To use this code, you will need to find an appropriate balloon image, save it to your own image folder in the file system and change the coding as needed to reflect your image's file name. Then, launch the html in your browser to play the game.
